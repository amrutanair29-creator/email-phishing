i used an tool called mozilla thunderbird,
created an phishing email,
tooked an sample template for better understanding from the google.com
copy pasted it and then understood whats going with the picture
tried sending it on my own account to check out but SMTP (outgoing server) had an issues
i tried solving frequently on own with authentication but didn't got solved
used chatgpt and youtube for understanding SMTP error
checked email header , idntified suspicious link, email body, URLs, spelling and grammar errors
then found threat in the email
it helped me in analyzing phishing, spoofing, header analysis and also an threat detection
